      <p class="sectionsubtag"> In 2015, an estimated 175,000 persons died (148,707
        as per official reports of National Crime Records
        Bureau-2016) and 5,250,000 were hospitalized 
        due to road crashes in India. This number has been
        increasing from year to year and loss of so many
        precious lives, predominantly young males, should
        be of serious concern to everyone. While every <br>
        death and disabled person is an unbearable loss
        and burden to their families, the collective loss to
        Indian society is huge and phenomenal in economic
        terms, roughly amounting to 3 % of total GDP.</p>

      <p class="sectionsubtag">Macro-economic and developmental policies/programmes are interwoven and
        driven by trade, commerce, industrialization, urbanization, migration, and others.
        The liberalized economic policies of successive Indian governments has brought 
        significant changes in all these areas during the last 2 decades. Indian population
        increased from 1.03 billion in 2001 to 1.31 billion by 2015, an increase of 27%. Urban
        India has grown by 12.2%, from 27.7% in 2001 to 31.1% in 2011. (1) Estimates indicate
        that nearly 41% of the Indian population will be urban by 2030. The number of rural 
        migrants increased from 314 million (1991–2001) to 453 million (2001–2011) during
        this decade. The per capita income of an Indian has increased from INR.17917 in year
        2000-01 to INR.93231 by 2015-16,(2) indicating the growing purchasing or spending
        power of Indians. </p>
